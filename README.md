# Covid-19 Simple Tracker
> A simple COVID-19 manifestation tracker

## How does it work?
With **Selenium** and the power of **Python**, with a few lines of code we can capture the information on the web and use it however we want! By the way, in this case are created some files: 
+ GeneralStats.json
+ GeneralStats.txt

+ [Country]Stats.json
+ [Country]Stats.txt
...

The json file we can use it later easily on whatever language/platform of programming that accept the **JSON** format.
<br/>
The second one is a little text that indicates the situation in a way more formatted and easy to open in any **OS**.

## Dependencies
The only dependency that I have used is **Selenium**, if you don't have it yet just type the following command on your terminal
<br/>
```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Comments
I used the Chrome, so if you don't, you'll need to change the driver in the application.
<br/>
But if you use Chrome just like me, you'll need to install the updated chromedriver for your Chrome's version.
<br/>
The Xpath may change, so it's always a good idea to check the original path if any error appear.
The most common error related with Xpath, is the "No such element". So if you see this error surrounding you,
check the Xpath.
