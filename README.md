# Covid-19 Simple Tracker
> A simple COVID-19 manifestation tracker for Brasil

## How does it work?
With **Selenium** and the power of **Python**, with a few lines of code we can capture the information on the web and use it however we want! By the way, in this case are created two files: 
+ Stats.json
+ Stats.txt

The first file we can use it later easily on whatever language/platform of programming that accept the **JSON**.
<br/>
The second one is a little text that indicates the situation in a way more formatted and easy to open in any OS.

## Dependencies
The only dependency that I have used is **Selenium**, if you don't have it yet just type the following command on your terminal
<br/>
```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Comments
I used the Chrome, so if you don't, you'll need to change the driver in the application.
<br/>
But if you use Chrome just like me, you'll need to install the updated chromedriver for your Chrome's version.
<br/>
The Xpath may change, so it's always a good idea to check the original path if any error appear.
